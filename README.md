# Kidney Disease Classification - Deep Learning Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of kidney disease using deep learning techniques. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately distinguish between healthy and diseased kidney conditions based on medical data. The project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of medical images related to kidney disease. It includes:

- Healthy kidney images
- Diseased kidney images

Preprocessing techniques such as data augmentation, normalization, and resizing are applied to enhance the dataset's quality and model performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SyedRizwan165/Kidney-Disease-Classification-Deep-Learning-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Kidney-Disease-Classification-Deep-Learning-project
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Run

To train the model, run:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Future Improvements
